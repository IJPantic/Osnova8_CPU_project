Memory Access Layer (MAL):
	DIrect: CPU can access memory directly as ADD (ADdress Device)
	InDirectX (where X is number of layers of ADD until CPU can reach memory): CPU can access only thru other ADD

Memory Data Retention (MDR):
	Long-Term: Data is stored even with power off
	Short-Term: Data is lost if power is cut

Memory Data Interactability (MDI):
	Write-Only: Device that controls memory can only read it's contents
	Read-Only: Device that controls memory can only write content to it
	Read-Write: Device can both read and write content to memory

Memory description formula:
	MAL-MDR-MDI (Note that if MAL specification part is left out, it is assumed that it is DI type)
	Example; ROM: LT-RO, RAM: ST-RW, EEPROM: LT-RW
